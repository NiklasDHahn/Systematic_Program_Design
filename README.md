# Systematic_Program_Design
This repository contains all file that I created for the edx course Systematic Program Design - Part 1

The course is an introductory level computer science course available (archived) in [edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+2T2015).
The folder `starter_files` contains all the empty problem sets that I could access via the video material. Since I did this course in 2024 that file repository was not available to me anymore, so I had to manually transfer the text from the starter files into my own files, which means that some files of this course might be missing. Also I did not have access to any additional problem sets for the same reason.

The folder `solutions` contains all problem sets where I filled in the code. This is either by following the video material and copying the code that was written there, coming up with my own solutions and sometimes correct them by the video solutions if neccessary or some hybrid of the two methods.

The folder `notes` contains markdown files with my course notes.
