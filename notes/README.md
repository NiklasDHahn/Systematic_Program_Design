# Course Notes
This Computer Science (CS) course teaches recipes for designing functions, data, and worlds using the Beginning Student Language (BSL). In order to execute any code in this language for this course the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Dr.Racket is used and needs to be installed in advance. My lecture notes do not match the structure of the course exactly but I tried to stay close to it. The different topics of this course are called chapters in my notes and I start with chapter 1, which is an introduction in BSL, while the course page labels this topic as _0. Introduction_. Other than that the chapter names in my notes follow those in the program, but subchapter might vary.
